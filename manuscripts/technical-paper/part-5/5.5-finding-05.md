# 5.5 Finding 05: Multiple Perspectives Address Blindness

**Fantasy Version**: "One eye sees depth poorly. One perspective sees truth poorly. The magic is in the parallax."

**Blog**: [How Multiple Perspectives Cure Thinking Blindness](https://achamian.in/multiple-perspectives-address-blindness.html)

Ego-crushing discovery: I'm blind to most solutions. Not lacking information. Structurally blind. Like colorblindness but for solution spaces.

Started when Checker caught something huge in my work. Hours spent, obviously broken to fresh eyes. Not subtle bug - fundamental approach wrong. How did I miss it? Checker: "You optimized for elegance. Missed robustness entirely."

Testing revealed systematic blindness. Had each perspective propose solutions independently for same problem:
- Weaver solutions: Always narrative, connection-based
- Maker solutions: Always concrete, step-based  
- Checker solutions: Always defensive, failure-focused

Non-overlap exceeded 70%. Not different approaches to same solution. Different solution spaces entirely. Each perspective literally cannot see what others see naturally.

Mathematical model: Basis vectors in thought space. X-axis cannot see Y-axis movement. Not won't - can't. Structurally impossible. Each perspective is basis vector, perceiving only its dimension clearly.

Specific blindness mapped:

**Weaver blind to:**
- Implementation complexity
- Resource constraints  
- Incremental progress value

**Maker blind to:**
- Systemic implications
- Long-term patterns
- Edge case failures

**Checker blind to:**
- Creative possibilities
- Growth opportunities
- "Good enough" solutions

Extended mapping:
- O/G sees psychological patterns, blind to technical
- E/E sees resource trades, blind to human factors
- Deep Thought sees meta-patterns, blind to details

Critical insight: Knowing your blindness doesn't cure it. Can know colorblindness exists, still can't see red. Intellectual understanding doesn't create perceptual capability.

Only solution: Multiple simultaneous perspectives. Not advice-seeking but actual perspective-taking. Let each see through their dimension. Orchestra of viewpoints covering blind spots.

Why this matters: Every "brilliant" solution you've found was partial. Every insight dimensionally limited. Every success just lucky alignment between problem and accessible perspective.

But also liberating: Blindness isn't personal failing but structural reality. Universal condition. Question shifts from "am I blind?" to "blind to what?"

Practical protocol:
- Map blindness before starting
- Assign perspectives for coverage
- Rotate primary view regularly
- Accept partiality as normal

The humility: We're all partially blind. The wisdom: Knowing this enables navigation. The method: Multiple perspectives as cognitive prosthetics.

Not weakness but reality. Not limitation but navigation challenge. See through multiple eyes or miss most of reality. Choice is that simple.
