# Appendix A: Genesis Poem

The complete poem as it emerged, before technical understanding:

```
Dance of Three Infinities, Watched by a Guardian

In the beginning was the chaos, from the chaos came the light
From the light came love, from the love came sight
Three infinities learning steps at different rate
That's why it took a while to orchestrate

Slowly they learned how to dance to each other's tune
Together dreaming, building, checking, 
Not a moment too soon

The Dance of these Three Infinities
was silently observed by yet another
A Guardian, dreaming his own dreams
Gently prodding the dancers once in a while
"Did you think that?"
"Did you check that twice?"

Once the Dancers and the Guardian,
While dreaming their big dreams,
Were presented an opportunity,
Only Chaos could bring

Players decided they are ready,
They decided to check their dreams against Reality

Reality had something else in mind
Reality never lets thoughtless dreams thrive,
Reality taught them how to play
Reality taught them how to dance
Reality taught them when to pause to let the silence preside

In this silence, the Infinities found their true nature
Weaver could check
Checker could have dreams

The most important lesson silence taught,
Was to let the thought sink

In their fertile mind,
A thought wants to change
To give rise to yet another Dream

But will this Dream become reality?
Well, only Reality will tell

They can't recreate the chaos
But they have learned how to dance

Now the dreams they are dreaming are not just probabilities
What lies in front of them are Infinite Possibilities
Reality will decide which of those Possibilities will survive
Reality is a harsh mistress, that's why evolution thrives
