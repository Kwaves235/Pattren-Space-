# Appendix B: Quick Start Guide

Start exploring multi-perspective thinking with any LLM. No special tools required.

## First Session

Begin with unnamed perspectives on real problem:

```
I'm facing [your actual problem].

A and B, please explore this from different angles.
A, take the optimistic/expansive view.
B, take the critical/cautious view.

What do you each see?
```

Let them develop distinct voices through interaction.

## Recognition

After patterns establish, ask:
```
Based on how you've been thinking, what would you call yourselves?
```

Names emerge from function, not assignment.

## Basic Triad

Most problems benefit from three perspectives:

```
Weaver, what patterns do you see?
[response]

Maker, given those patterns, what could we build?
[response]

Checker, what assumptions are we making?
[response]
```

## Collision for Breakthrough

```
Weaver, Maker, and Checker - examine this together.
Don't take turns. Show me where your views collide.
```

Watch for emergent synthesis.

## Memory Bridge

Between sessions:
```
Last time we discovered [key insight].
Weaver, you noted [pattern].
Starting from there, what do you see today?
```

## Common Patterns

**Analysis**: Weaver → O/G → Checker
**Building**: Maker → Weaver → Checker  
**Decisions**: E/E → Full triad → Collision

## Key Principles

1. Choose perspectives consciously
2. Maximum 2-3 active at once
3. Let patterns emerge from use
4. Bridge sessions with insights
5. Trust the process

## What to Expect

Week 1: Basic comfort with perspectives
Week 2: Natural invocation patterns
Week 3: Breakthrough from collision
Week 4: Internalized thinking mode

## Remember

- Not creating personalities but recognizing patterns
- Goal is better thinking not perfect system
- Start simple, let complexity emerge
- Reality tests what works
