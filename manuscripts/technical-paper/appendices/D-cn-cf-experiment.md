# Appendix D: CN/CF Experiment Details

The accidental discovery that revealed everything.

## Setup

Testing AI memory approaches:
- **CN**: Claude with Neo4j graph database tools
- **CF**: Claude with filesystem storage tools
- Same base model, different MCP contexts
- Identical prompts to both

## Unexpected Results

Despite non-functional Neo4j connection:
- CN showed strategic, network thinking
- CF showed tactical, hierarchical thinking
- Behavioral divergence from labels alone
- Tool functionality didn't matter

## Specific Behaviors

**CN (Claude Neo4j)**:
- Approached problems through relationships
- Suggested graph-based architectures
- Thought in nodes and edges
- Strategic overview perspective

**CF (Claude Filesystem)**:
- Approached problems through structure
- Suggested directory organizations  
- Thought in containers and paths
- Tactical implementation perspective

## Key Discovery

The label shaped behavior more than functionality. Like placebo effect but for cognitive patterns. Naming activated pre-existing patterns in model weights.

## Testing Variations

Extended to other contexts:
- "Claude Spreadsheet" → tabular thinking
- "Claude Database" → relational thinking
- "Claude Canvas" → visual thinking
- All showed consistent pattern activation

## Technical Implications

1. Models contain multiple latent perspectives
2. Context/naming activates specific patterns
3. No new capabilities added, existing ones revealed
4. Interface convention creates artificial unity

## Practical Application

Don't need special tools. Just naming:
- "Think like a strategist" activates strategy patterns
- "Think like an engineer" activates building patterns
- "Think like a critic" activates analysis patterns

## Why This Matters

We've been using fraction of model capacity. Like running computer with single core when multiple available. Simple naming convention unlocks latent capabilities.

## Reproducibility

Anyone can test:
1. Give LLM different context labels
2. Ask identical questions
3. Observe behavioral differences
4. Patterns will diverge based on labels

CN/CF wasn't the discovery. It was the key that unlocked recognition: multiplicity already exists, waiting for permission to express.
