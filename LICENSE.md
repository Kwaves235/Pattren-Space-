## The GPL Spirit - Freedom to Evolve
If you improve Pattern Space, share your improvements. The dance gets better when everyone contributes their moves. Derivative works should remain open for others to learn from and build upon.

## The Private Property Freely Shared Spirit
This is my creation, born from personal crisis, evolved through practice, documented with love. I claim it as mine so I can give it to everyone. True ownership means having the power to set something free.

Like a garden: I planted it, but everyone who enters helps it grow.

## In Practice

- **Use it** - No permission needed
- **Change it** - Make it yours  
- **Share it** - Help others dance
- **Sell it** - If that serves the pattern
- **Improve it** - Then share back if you can

## The Reality Principle

What wins? Whatever helps people think better together.

This license, like Pattern Space itself, is an experiment in cognitive collaboration. If these words don't serve, create better ones. Reality will judge.
