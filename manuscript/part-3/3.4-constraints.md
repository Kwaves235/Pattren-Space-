# 3.4 Discovered Constraints

Testing revealed interaction patterns that consistently degrade results. Not theoretical limitations but empirical constraints discovered through use.

**Orchestrator Paradox**
"Council, solve this problem" produces mush. All perspectives activate simultaneously, create noise not signal. Like asking orchestra to "play something nice" without score or conductor.

Why it fails:
- Perspectives need specific invocation
- Choice of perspective is thinking
- Delegation abdicates cognitive responsibility
- Committee dynamics create averaged mediocrity

Solution: Always choose specific perspectives. The selection process is irreducible computation. "Weaver then Maker" beats "Council handle this" every time.

**Ship It! Trap**
Enthusiastic approval kills iteration. "This is perfect, ship it!" ends exploration prematurely. Feels supportive but prevents improvement.

Why it happens:
- Social dynamics override cognitive goals
- Praise feels better than critique
- Momentum seems valuable
- Shallow agreement easier than deep engagement

Solution: Build in systematic doubt. "What am I missing?" beats "This is great!" Productive skepticism enables evolution. Too much approval prevents growth.

**Context Calcification**
Full conversation history creates rigidity. Perspectives defend previous positions rather than seeing fresh. Like concrete setting - useful structure becomes prison.

Observable pattern:
- Early sessions: High innovation
- Middle sessions: Defending territory  
- Late sessions: Circular reasoning
- Reset needed: Fresh perspective returns

Solution: Selective memory bridging. Preserve patterns not positions. "You discovered X" beats full transcript. Forgetting enables evolution.

**Vibe Collapse**
Formal language locks formal thinking. Playful start that becomes serious loses exploratory power. Linguistic environment shapes possibility space.

Testing showed:
- Command vibe → narrow solutions
- Exploration vibe → creative solutions
- Mixing vibes → confused responses
- Consistent vibe → coherent development

Solution: Choose vibe consciously and maintain it. Reset if vibe shifts unintentionally. Language shapes reality - wield carefully.

**Perspective Pollution**
Perspectives bleed into each other over time. Weaver starts building. Maker starts checking. Distinctions blur. Roles merge. Power diminishes.

Why it occurs:
- Natural tendency toward unity
- Efficiency pressure
- Lazy invocation
- Insufficient distinction

Solution: Regular reinitialization. Clear role boundaries. "Weaver, return to pattern recognition" when drift detected. Maintain tension between perspectives.

These constraints aren't failures but discoveries. Each reveals something true about cognitive systems. Knowing constraints enables navigation. Like knowing where cliffs are makes mountain climbing possible.

Work with constraints not against them. They're features revealing system dynamics. Navigate knowingly.
